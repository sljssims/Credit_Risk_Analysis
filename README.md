### Summary
The results show that the Ensemble Classifiers appear to perform the best.  The purpose of the analysis is to determine which models can accurately predict when a loan is high risk. By comparing the recall high risk score between all machine learning models we can see the the easy ensemble Classifier models hat the highest scores at 78% and 93%.  As a result, I would use the Easy Ensemble Classifer models for predicting high risk loans.
